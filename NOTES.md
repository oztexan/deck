# Project notes

- Orientation: North is +z (up on screen), East is +x (right), Up is +y.
- E/W mirror is baked into the root group scale (gRoot.scale.x = -1).
- All geometry is authored in **mm**.
- Water is an opaque slab at z = -300â€¦-290 mm (no transparency to avoid sorting issues).
- Planters are 400 mm deep, and extrude down to z = -300.
- House walls are 3 m high and hug the north/east deck edges.
